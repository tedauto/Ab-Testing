# Tiktok AB Testing
# Business Understanding  
Determine and conduct the necessary hypothesis tests and statistical analysis for the TikTok classification project.
# Data Understanding
- The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze hypothesis tests.
- The goal is to apply descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing in Python.
# Hypothesis Testing 
## Research Question
Research question for this data project:
- Do videos from verified accounts and videos unverified accounts have different average view counts?
- Is there a relationship between the account being verified and the associated videos' view counts?
# Modeling
- Two sample T test (Test of Means)
- **Null hypothesis:** There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).
- **Alternative hypothesis:** There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and those posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the
corresponding population means).
Given that the p value is more than 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
# Conclusion  
- Given that the p value is more than 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- There is a difference in the number of views btwn Tiktok videos posted by verified account and those posted by unverified accounts.
- **Further analysis would be useful to identify whether this phenomenon is influenced by user behavior.**
